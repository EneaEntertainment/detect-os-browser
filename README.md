# detect-os-browser
Detects used OS and browser by parsing navigator.userAgent string

Motivation : detect Apple mobile device with 'request desktop website' setting turned on (tested with Chrome, Firefox, Safari)

Today Apple has no Macs with touch screen - which detection routine relies on.
However that can change in future and break things...
     
Based on detection routines kindly borrowed from Phaser (https://github.com/photonstorm/phaser)
